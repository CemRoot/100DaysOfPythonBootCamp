* Create a portfolio of 100 Python projects to apply for developer jobs
* Be able to build fully fledged websites and web apps with Python
* Be able to use Python for data science and machine learning
* Build games like Blackjack, Pong and Snake using Python
* Build GUIs and Desktop applications with Python


## **How is the camp going?**

A new code is written every day and divided into sections.

* The files you see as `[Day-1]` are exercise tasks.
Seeing missing days in exercises **does not mean** that day has been skipped.
This means that the exercise assignments given by the teacher that day has been completed.


* `Beginner- Project` Folder is the folder where the projects given that day are located.
There are also `read.me` files in this folder.
These files contain the details of the project.


* The `First-Read-Me-Folder` file contains the `license.md` file.
Also in this folder is the `"Python Syntax Cheat Sheet Book"` file.
By examining this file, you can quickly browse the information you forgot.


* In the `First-Read-Me-Folder` file, the pdf you see with the name [`Python-Summary`](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkOqd5zWYaEahLwMemJsOtzfD6TyFg) is the python 
summaries I received within 100 days, all writing belongs to Cem Köylüoğlu (Only Turkish Lang.).

The contract you see below is a promise before I start the course that I will stick to the course.
